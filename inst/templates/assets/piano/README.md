#Piano sounds:
Those sounds were originally downloaded from 
[here](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html)
only C3 Major scale, C4 Major Scale, and C5 Major Scale files were downloaded, 22 files in total.
The files were renamed to track1 - track22, keeping the same order of the original files, when C3 note renamed to track1, D3 to track2, and so on...
The files were also edited as follows:
* Using iTunes, the files were converted from aiff format to mp3
* Using Audacity, the files were edited according to the following steps:
    * Truncated the silence found at the beginning of each file
    * Shortened each track to be 3 seconds long
    * Added a fade out effect to the end of each track
